    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Joe Akindele A Full-Stack Developer specializing in the MEAN stack (MongoDB,
      Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and WordPress. I craft responsive, high-performance, and
      scalable web applications and websites, with a strong focus on clean code and real-world
      problem-solving. I build with SEO and web accessibility in mind, ensuring that every solution
      is discoverable, inclusive, and user-friendly for all audiences. I'm a quick learner who
      adapts seamlessly to new technologies and project needs. I enjoy working closely with clients
      to turn ideas into impactful digital experiences, and I thrive in collaborative team
      environments, bringing positive energy and a solution-oriented mindset to every project. Let's
      build something amazing together.

      When I’m not coding, I’m probably in the gym, or watching football.

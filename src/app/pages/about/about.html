    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Joseph Akindele</strong> â€” a passionate Web Developer and 
      WordPress specialist, now expanding into full-stack development with 
      the <strong>MEAN stack</strong> (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js).
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy building responsive, user-friendly websites and applications, 
      and Iâ€™m especially motivated by solving real-world problems through 
      clean, accessible code.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m planning my next big project, exploring new 
      technologies, or working toward my long-term goal of pursuing a 
      Masterâ€™s in AI & Robotics ðŸ¤–.
